Description
this mod takes up the concept of putting maps from Half-Life 2 into a puzzle game called Portal.

For all Half-Life 2 content in Portal, we have been 100% repaired:



what is redone by me:
Recompile maps due to a crash.
Submachine guns in Half-Life 2 maps have ammunition (because originally there was none so they could not be fired).
Gravity Gun and RPG (Rocket Launcher) sprites have been fixed.
Remove "Portal Credits" to Restore intro and credit color.
NPCs can store their weapons (except Father Grigori who has two shotguns in the map "d1_town_02").
Added the x06 HUD and Effect (the alternative color of the orange portals) "hud_portal_x06 and cl_portalgun_x06" Change the colors of the HUD and Effects on your Portal Gun!
Added command for air move "sv_player_airmove"
Add all Half-Life 2 series repair models and scripts.

The mod version is made to be played in the Source SDK 2013!
what is remade by its creator:
The HUD Quick is visible with the Crosshair of Beta Version (2005 / 2006) and the Crosshair utilities of the Final Version (2007 / 2012) "beta_quickinfo 1|0".
NPCs can shoot.
the "Magnusson Device" in Half-Life 2: Episode Two has been fixed due to a crash.
Fall damage is toggleable with "sv_receive_fall_damage".
Crowbar swings through Portals.
You can rapid click to shoot Portals faster, like in Portal 2.
You can erase portals by reloading Portal Gun.
Flashlight is enabled.
Shoot portals below existing NPCs like: "Turret Floor", "Manhack" and "Rollermine" but other entities cannot be teleported unfortunately.
Fixed "third person" bugs with "first person" models through Portals!

But the version that plays with the original game.
For your gameplay, I strongly recommend that you be very careful where you place your portals because it will show you this kind of error:

Error



Since you get the "Portal Gun" I advise you to be very careful not to skip the important scenarios and not to forget the main NPCs who follow you like for example Alyx Vance.

You can play mods from Half-Life 2! (keeping the same functionality).

Inspired of "Half-Life 2 with Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device" mod 0.8.3 beta
